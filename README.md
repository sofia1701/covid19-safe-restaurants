## Safe Restaurants

This project aims to create a restaurant search engine that allows a user to identify restaurants in Manchester area that follow the most in demand security practices or provide delivery alternatives in times that require people to follow social distancing measures.

The user will be able to save favourites and rate restaurants after logging in or register in our website.

The restaurants listed will come from our backend which you'll be able to find here: <br/>

The backend functionality for Login/Register, also developed by our team, can be found in: <br/>
